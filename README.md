# AO-App-GTM-SaaS

AO App go-to-market SaaS

## Features

New AO Apps / Games can use this SaaS to:

- launch their tokens
- have a invite to earn program in seconds
- help their potential users to buy their assets via ethereum

Also we create a ao/lua code pattern in out examples

## Reasons for this project

As I have been all in web3 for two years now, I have been building over 20+ PoC, and launch 5 MVPs.

But still lack of a good web3 Go-To-Market SaaS for my ideas.

Also I build the ao-snake game, and I realized that the game need to keep with marketing and business in mind.

Why not just build one Go-To-Market SaaS by myself?

That is how the LaunchPad was born in the https://ub.rwa-wallet.com (currently not ready for public yet)

This platform I have been integrated with SwapKit and wormhole SDK that can bridge hundreds of tokens to any chains.

And I am working on add ao support for it, so it will open the gate for the assets to run into ao world.

## How the LaunchPad works

We use AO-Snake as an example to show how the LaunchPad works.
Here AO-Snake game is the third party game vendor.

1. Vendor create a new project on the launchpad
2. Vendor setup the project with the token information, and the business logic for the invite to earn program
